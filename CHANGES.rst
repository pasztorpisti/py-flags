CHANGES
=======


v1.1.3
------

*Release date: 2019-10-05*

- Fix: ``@unique_bits`` had a trivial but fatal bug: it turned classes to ``None``.


v1.1.2
------

*Release date: 2016-12-13*

- Fix: `len()` of abstract flags classes caused the following exception:
  ``AttributeError: type object 'Flags' has no attribute '__all_members__'``


v1.1.1
------

*Release date: 2016-12-13*

- Fix: added the ``@unique`` and ``@unique_bits`` decorators to the ``__all__`` list of the flags module.
- Fix: testing abstract flags classes for truth value caused the following exception:
  ``AttributeError: type object 'Flags' has no attribute '__all_members__'``


v1.1.0
------

*Release date: 2016-04-29*

- Extended README.rst with full documentation. Before it contained only a "Quick Overview" section.
- Added ``Flags.__dotted_single_flag_str__``.
- The ``Flags.data`` property returns ``UNDEFINED`` for special flags and flag combinations.
- Added the ``__pickle_int_flags__`` class attribute that can be set to ``True`` in order to force pickle to save
  the ``int`` representation of flags instead of the default ``to_simple_str()`` representation.
- Added the ``@unique_bits`` decorator that can be used to forbid overlapping bits between the values of flags.
- Added the ``@unique`` decorator that can be used to forbid aliases in a flags class. (An alias is a flag that
  has the exact same value as a previously declared flag.)
- Added ``__repr__`` for flags classes.


v1.0.1
